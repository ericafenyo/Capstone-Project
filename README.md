# Capstone Project

I made a News app as my Udacity Android Development Course final project
and the followings are required in order to use or test the app

1. Java sdk 8 and above
2. Dark Sky API key : https://darksky.net/dev
3. Google Places and Maps AP keys

Follow the simple TODOs in order to setup your valid API keys and voil√†!, build and run the app
