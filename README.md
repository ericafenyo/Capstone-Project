# Capstone Project


Overview

For this project, you will make your own app. You can either come up with your own idea or select from one of the ideas listed under App Ideas. You are welcome to reuse blocks of code from [earlier courses/projects] to create your new app, but the project you design should be entirely your own.  
Before you start working on the project:

Review the final project rubric carefully. Think about the following questions:
How will you incorporate each of the rubric criterions into your project?
Why are these aspects important?
What is your strategy to ensure that your project “meets specifications” in the given criteria?
Once you are convinced that you understand each part of the rubric, please start working on your project. Remember to refer to the rubric often to ensure that you are on the right track.
Two Phase Submission Process:

Before you begin building your app of choice, we’d like to review your design. This mimics a common situation you may find on the job where a project is planned, specified and then reviewed before actual development is given a greenlight to commence.
Phase 1: Submit a proposal for your app idea for review

This is what you will do:
Template here
Pick an app to build, and draft a one page summary of what the app does, and what problem it solves. Here is an example of a final project description for a Reddit App.
Create mocks for all user-facing screens for both mobile phones and tablets. Hand-drawn sketches are OK, but they must be saved in a digital format that you can share with
Draft a Project Requirement Document/specification document that outlines a technical plan on how you plan to implement your app idea. ( similar to the implementation guides that you’ve seen through projects within this nanodegree )
Specifically call out any libraries you plan to use and for what purpose
Outline the data needs of your app and how you plan to manage them ( sharedPreferences , Content Provider etc… )
Submit this document for review. Once you review approval, you have a Udacity thumbs up to commence building your app!
Phase 2: Submit your app src code for final grading

Build your app using your specification documents as a guide!
When you are ready to submit, please follow the Final Submission Instructions to submit your project.
Project Requirements
Your Project must:
Import and build on the latest version of Android Studio (Eclipse users take note)
Be entirely self-contained on an Android device (No external devices/bluetooth peripherals).
Include a problem description of the problem your app solves.
Include mocks for all user-facing screens.
Include a signed .apk of your app. Instructions on creating a signed .apk can be found here.
Include at least one alternate mock for tablet / large screens.
Implement all mockups, including your tablet layout.
Have at least two distinct screens (ex. a list view and a detail view).
Work properly with the app lifecycle (i.e. you must preserve any dynamic instance state on orientation change).
Use permissions responsibly.
Use Intents to move between activities inside your app or to an outside app.
Create and use your own ContentProvider
Use Loaders to move your data to your views.
If the application pulls or sends data to/from a web service or API, it handles this network activity properly (i.e on the correct thread, does not abuse network resources)
Include only safe-for-work content in your app
